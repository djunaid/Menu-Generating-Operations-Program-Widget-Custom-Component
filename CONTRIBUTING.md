# Contributing guidelines
- The scope of the Component is an important thing to keep in mind while you are developing. You will need to make changes to the name of the scope in order to deploy it to your instance and test any changes without affecting the original Menu Item component. This way, you can always have the default page with the original working component, then have a variant where you are testing your changes. You will be walked through the steps to achieve this under [Making changes to the component](README.md#making-changes-to-the-component).
- If you want to contribute changes to the Experience Page itself, be sure to go to the [sister repository](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Menu-Generating-Operations-Program-Widget-Experience-Page) and work from there. Always make a Variant to make changes to!
- Pull request descriptions must be explicit and descriptive of what is being changed.  
- Changes that are not within the scope of the description will result in the entire PR being rejected.
- Low-effort/spam Pull Requests will be marked as spam accordingly.
